## Introduction

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. In this project, we provide a framework for training YOLO models on custom datasets, enabling users to detect specific objects of interest in images and videos.

## Features

- Support for YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models.
- Custom dataset preparation and annotation tools.
- Configurable training parameters.
- Real-time evaluation of model performance.
- Visualization of detection results.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xfrx8/Yolo_train.git
cd Yolo_train
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure that you have Python 3.7+ and CUDA installed for GPU acceleration.

## Usage

### Dataset Preparation

1. **Annotation**: Use tools like LabelImg or Roboflow to annotate your dataset in YOLO format.
2. **Organize Data**: Place your images and corresponding annotation files in the `data/` directory, organized as follows:
   ```
   data/
   ├── images/
   │   ├── train/
   │   ├── val/
   │   └── test/
   └── labels/
       ├── train/
       ├── val/
       └── test/
   ```
3. **Update Config**: Modify the `data.yaml` file to reflect your dataset structure and classes.

### Training the Model

To start training, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py --data data.yaml --cfg yolov5s.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --epochs 50
```

Replace `yolov5s.yaml` with the configuration file of your choice and adjust the number of epochs as needed.

### Evaluating the Model

After training, evaluate the model's performance on the validation set:

```bash
python val.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --data data.yaml
```

This will provide metrics such as mAP (mean Average Precision) and IoU (Intersection over Union).

## Results

Include some examples of the model's performance here. You can add images or links to visualizations that show how well the model detects objects.

## Contributing
